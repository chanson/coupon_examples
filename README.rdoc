== README

This is a small project to demonstrate some `Coupon` models I have worked on. The app itself has no front-end
or API at the moment, just some data models and specs to explain the architecture for a scenario
where a `Coupon` needs to have flexible configurability for determining whether or not it can be applied.

The `Coupon::Validator` represents a less extensible approach, combined with my `ValidationRules` approach
to show how it can be beneficial.
